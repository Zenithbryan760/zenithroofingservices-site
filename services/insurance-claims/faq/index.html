<summary>Do I need a tarp right away?</summary>
<div class="faq-body"><p>If water is entering the home or roof coverings are missing, tarping or a temporary dry‑in helps limit additional damage while permanent work is scheduled.</p></div>
</details>
<details class="faq-item" role="listitem">
<summary>Will you meet my insurance adjuster?</summary>
<div class="faq-body"><p>Yes. We meet adjusters on site, provide photos and scopes, and support supplements when the initial scope misses required work.</p></div>
</details>
<details class="faq-item" role="listitem">
<summary>Repair or full replacement — how is that decided?</summary>
<div class="faq-body"><p>We assess overall condition, code requirements, and manufacturer standards. When localized repairs are viable, we’ll present that option; if the system is at or near end‑of‑life, replacement may be more durable.</p></div>
</details>
<details class="faq-item" role="listitem">
<summary>Can you help with photos and documentation?</summary>
<div class="faq-body"><p>Yes. We produce a photo set and line‑item scope you can share with your adjuster. If we proceed with work, these become part of the project file.</p></div>
